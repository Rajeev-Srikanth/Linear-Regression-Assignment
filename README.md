### Assignment Summary

The assignment focuses on building a **multiple linear regression model** to predict the demand for shared bikes using a dataset that includes various factors potentially influencing bike demand. The objective is to identify significant variables and understand how well these variables explain the variation in demand.

### Problem Context
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced a drop in revenues due to the ongoing pandemic. As conditions improve, the company seeks to predict bike demand in order to strategically plan for the post-pandemic period and remain competitive. The company aims to understand which factors influence the demand for shared bikes, particularly as the market recovers.

### Business Goal
The primary goal is to model the demand for shared bikes based on independent variables such as weather, time of day, and other external factors. The insights derived from this model will help BoomBikes adjust its business strategy to meet demand effectively and cater to customer needs. Additionally, the model can be applied to new markets, providing a predictive tool to optimize operations.

### Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** The first step is to clean the dataset by addressing missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring that the data is in the proper format for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This step involves both univariate and multivariate analysis to explore individual variables and the relationships between them. Key patterns influencing bike demand are identified through this process.
3. **Feature Identification:** Significant variables that impact bike demand are selected. This could include factors like temperature, season, time of day, or external events.
4. **Regression Model:** A multiple linear regression model is built using the identified features. The model is trained and evaluated to determine its effectiveness in predicting bike demand.
5. **Visualization:** Key findings from the analysis and model results are visualized through graphs and charts to make the insights more accessible and understandable.

The final model provides a tool for BoomBikes to predict demand more accurately, helping them plan operations and adjust their strategies accordingly.

### Key Deliverable
The deliverable for this assignment is a **Jupyter notebook** that includes the full process, from data cleaning to model evaluation. The notebook showcases visualizations, model insights, and performance metrics to guide decision-making. This predictive model can help BoomBikes optimize resource allocation and make informed strategic decisions as the market recovers.
