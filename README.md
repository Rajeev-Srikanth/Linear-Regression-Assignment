### Assignment Summary

The assignment involves building a **multiple linear regression model** to predict the demand for shared bikes. The dataset provided includes various factors influencing bike demand, and your task is to identify the significant variables and understand how well these variables explain the demand.

### Problem Context
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has faced a decline in revenues due to the ongoing pandemic. As the situation improves, BoomBikes aims to predict bike demand to effectively plan for the future and remain competitive in the market. The company seeks to understand how various factors influence the demand for shared bikes, especially post-pandemic.

### Business Goal
Your model will help BoomBikes understand the relationship between bike demand and independent variables (such as weather, time, demographics, etc.). The insights will guide the company in adjusting its business strategy and preparing for future demand levels. The model will also be valuable in expanding to new markets and meeting customer expectations.

### Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct univariate and multivariate analysis to understand the distribution of variables and the relationships between them.
3. **Feature Identification:** Identify which variables significantly impact bike demand, such as temperature, season, or time of day.
4. **Regression Model:** Use multiple linear regression to build a predictive model, selecting the best features and evaluating its performance.
5. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate key insights and model findings.

The goal is to create a model that helps BoomBikes predict demand effectively, optimize its operations, and strategize for post-pandemic success.

### Key Deliverable
- A **Jupyter notebook** that includes the steps taken, from data preparation to model building and results evaluation. The notebook should showcase the insights drawn from the analysis, including visualizations and model performance metrics.

This project aligns with the business goal of BoomBikes to enhance decision-making and optimize resource allocation based on predicted bike demand.
